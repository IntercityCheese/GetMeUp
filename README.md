# GetMeUp
GetMeUp is an alarm clock app written mostly in flutter designed with commuters in mind to ensure they are never late ever again.

## Features
- Used London Underground and National rail API's to allow the app to dynamically adjust alarm time or route (prefered if possible) to ensure that if needed, the user is woken up early enough to catch an earlier train.
- A configurable sleep limit (max 3 when enabled) gives you a few extra minutes of sleep (1-10 mins configurable) before blasting them with a full volume alarm that can only be turned off depending on different _Rules_. Including:
  - Move phone certain distance (Min 1)
  - Shake phone for length of time
  - Scan QR code/Barcode (ideal)
- More features coming soon

The first functioning version is almost ready -> Stay tuned!
